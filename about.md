I'm a curious CS graduate student exploring and trying to learn things well and also help others learn well. Recently, I'm more into Machine Learning and at times brushing up my problem-solving skill.

### Academics

I'm currently pursuing M.Tech-I.T. with specialisation in Machine learning and Intelligent Systems at IIIT - Allahabad.
Recently I finished my B.Tech degree from UIET Kanpur.
